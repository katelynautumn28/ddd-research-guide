## About 
This research guide provides digitized images of administrative records that may be useful for conducting research on the history of divestment, dissent, and discipline on Barnardâ€™s campus. This guide may also be used as the basis for a class or workshop on how to conduct archival research on histories of activism and protest.

This guide was created by Katelyn Landry, a Barnard Archives Graduate Fellow during the 2024-25 academic year. It was created within the context of intense political and social turmoil in the U.S, especially in higher education institutions. Recent events have fueled increased requests from researchers for materials related to histories of campus protest and activism. In response to that demand, this guide is intended to aid researchers in identifying relevant materials for their inquiries. 

This guide also serves as an affirmation of the right to protest and freedom of expression on college campuses. By looking to the archive for evidence of past organizing, activism, and negotiations, the archive may serve as a tool for fortifying solidarity, understanding, and accountability on campuses today and in the future.
