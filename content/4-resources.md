## Continue your research at Barnard

The collections highlighted in this research guide are only a few examples of materials that might be helpful for researching histories of divestment, dissent, and discipline at Barnard. You can continue your research by: 
- Searching the archives of student periodicals such as the [Barnard Bulletin](https://digitalcollections.barnard.edu/bulletin) and the [Columbia Spectator](https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/) to identify past actions (protests and sit-ins), discussions between students and admin, or student opinions on how the administration was operating.
- Exploring the [Barnard Zine Library](https://zines.barnard.edu/), which holds numerous zines created by activists from Barnard and New York City. Try searching keywords and phrases like divest*, activis*, protest*, dissent, discipline, student conduct, rally, or march in the [CLIO](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog) library catalog or [ask a zine librarian](mailto:zines@barnard.edu). 
- Searching the Barnard Archives' [finding aids](https://collections.barnard.edu/public) and [digital collections](https://digitalcollections.barnard.edu/)
