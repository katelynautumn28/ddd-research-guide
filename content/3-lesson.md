## Anti-War and Civil Rights Protests

The student uprisings at Columbia University during the late 1960s and early 1970s are well documented in Barnard and Columbia archival collections, and have previously been explored in published works and digital exhibitions such as [1968: Columbia in Crisis](https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968). The demonstrations that took place on both Columbia and Barnard campuses during these years were launched by students protesting a range of interconnected issues, namely the Columbia administation's support for the United States' military intervention in Vietnam, anti-Black racist violence and discrimination, and Columbia's efforts to build a gymanasium in Morningside Park that would exclude members of the surrounding Harlem neihborhood. The materials presented in this section shed light on Barnard students' involvement in and support for these protests, as well as the responses from Barnard alums, administration, and parents. 

On May 7, 1965, Barnard and Columbia students gathered at Ferris Booth Hall and Low Library to protest the NROTC (Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps) at Columbia, a program that trains college students to become officers in the US Navy and Marine Corps. This letter from Zane Berzins (BC '65) provides Zane's account of the violent police response to the protest:

Box 35, Folder 1, President's Office Records, BC05-22. Barnard Archives and Special Collections." %} 

Berzins was one of several Barnard students who wrote to Dean Henry Boorse, Barnard's Dean of the Faculty, describing the nature of the protest and their participation in it to protest the police's violence toward students and the administration's disciplinary actions taken against a few students. Some students signed boilerplate statements confirming their participation or support for the protest, and voicing their opposition to the administration's actions to discipline protestors.

However, Barnard President Martha Peterson, responded to these letters with further disciplinary penalties:

Student protestors submitted written statements regarding their participation in an antiwar demonstration at Low Library on May 7, 1965.
