## Anti-War and Civil Rights Protests

The student uprisings at Columbia University during the late 1960s and early 1970s are well documented in Barnard and Columbia archival collections, and have previously been explored in published works such as this [2018 Barnard Magazine article by Professor Emerita of History Rosalind Rosenberg](https://barnard.edu/news/1968-barnard-historic-protests), and digital exhibitions such as [1968: Columbia in Crisis](https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968) curated by Jocelyn Wilk, and [From LeClair to Low Library: Barnard's Spring of 1968](https://barnardarchives.omeka.net/collections/show/3) curated by Rona Wilk (BC '91). The demonstrations that took place on both Columbia and Barnard campuses during these years were launched by students protesting a range of interconnected issues, namely the Columbia administation's support for the United States' military intervention in Vietnam, anti-Black racist violence and discrimination, and Columbia's efforts to build a gymanasium in Morningside Park that would exclude members of the surrounding Harlem neihborhood. The materials presented in this section shed light on Barnard students' involvement in and support for these protests, as well as the responses from Barnard alums, administration, and parents. The materials featured in this section are sourced from the [President's Office Records](https://collections.barnard.edu/public/repositories/2/resources/332) and [Office of Communications Records](https://collections.barnard.edu/public/repositories/2/resources/35)

On May 7, 1965, Barnard and Columbia students gathered at Ferris Booth Hall and Low Library during an annual awards ceremony for the NROTC (Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps) at Columbia, a program that trains college students to become officers in the US Navy and Marine Corps. This letter from Zane Berzins (BC '65) provides Zane's account of the violent police response to the protest:

Box 35, Folder 1, President's Office Records, BC05-22. Barnard Archives and Special Collections." %} 

Berzins was one of several Barnard students who wrote to Dean Henry Boorse, Barnard's Dean of the Faculty, describing the nature of the protest and their participation in it to protest the police's violence toward students and the administration's disciplinary actions taken against a few students. Some students signed boilerplate statements confirming their participation or support for the protest, and voicing their opposition to the administration's actions to discipline protestors.

Box 35, Folder 1, President's Office Records, BC05-22. Barnard Archives and Special Collections." %} 

In this letter, Jemera Rone Flug (BC '66) criticizes what she calls the administration's "complete lack of respect for due process" in the disciplinary hearings against student protestors:

Box 35, Folder 1, President's Office Records, BC05-22. Barnard Archives and Special Collections." %} 

However, Barnard President Martha Peterson responded to many of these testimonies, including the letter from Zane Berzins, with further disciplinary action:

<style>

<div id="my-pdf14"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/pdfobject"></script>

Box 35, Folder 1, President's Office Records, BC05-22. Barnard Archives and Special Collections." %} 

The Judicial Council mentioned by President Peterson was created just one year prior in 1964. According to the 1965-66 Barnard Student Handbook, the Council comprised of 5-7 students who were elected by the student body and 2-4 faculty members elected by the faculty. The Dean of Studies and President of the College were ex officio members. However, there was no official student code of conduct at Barnard until 1971. Thus, the grounds on which the Judicial Council prosecuted students for non-academic offenses are murky. 

The disciplinary procedures that the Judicial Council undertook in response to anti-war protests are illuminated in these letters from Margaret Emery, Chairman of the Judicial Council, to Jessica Holland regarding her protest activities in January and February of 1967:

Barnard President Rosemary Park confirmed the official censure of Holland in this letter:

In the following letter from the Judicial Council, they issued what appears to be a warning to Suzanne Crowell for her participation in a protest of an NROTC course:

Starting in April 1968, student members and supporters of Columbia's Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) chapter and the Society of Afro-American Students (SAS) launched several major demonstrations and occupations protesting the universities' involvement in the Vietnam War and construction of the Morningside Park gymnasium. Beginning with a dual SDS and SAS rally at Columbia's Sun Dial at noon on Tuesday, April 23, demonstrations evolved into several days-long occupations campus buildings by Barnard and Columbia students, as well as non-Columbia affiliated protestors. Hamilton Hall, Fayerweather Hall, Low Library, Avery Hall, and the Mathematics Hall, all on Columbia's campus, were occupied. Estimates of Barnard students' participation in the protests range from 100 to 300. The occupations were brought to a violent end on Tuesday, April 30, 1968 when New York City police fordibly removed student protestors, resulting in over 700 arrests of student protestors, including 111 Barnard students, and at least 148 injuries. The digital exhibition [1968: Columbia in Crisis](https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968) presents a detailed timeline of events with supporting archival materials from the Columbia University Archives and private collections.

Two telegrams from Barnard alums sent immediately after the police raid demonstrate their alarm and disapproval of the use of police force:

The events of April 30 also prompted the following statements from the student members of the Executive Board of the Undergraduate Association and members of the Voting Faculty, Teaching Staff, and Administration:

In the aftermath of the April 30 "bust," several students who participated in the strike formed the Strike Coordinating Committee to organize a campus-wide strike at Columbia for the rest of the spring 1968 semester. 

On May 21, 1968, over a hundred SDS members occupied Hamilton Hall once again, which led to another violent police response in the early hours of May 22. This document presents a list of Barnard students who were arrested at this time:

Columbia President Grayson Kirk and Vice President David Truman released statements strongly condemning the student protestors and promising disciplinary action:

It is unclear whether there was a press statement from Barnard President Martha Peterson released to the public, however in this letter, Peterson expresses her hesitation to release such a statement:

Parents of Barnard and Columbia students were also compelled to voice their opinions on the 1968 riots. Parents' reactions ranged from support for student protestors to condemnation of them:
