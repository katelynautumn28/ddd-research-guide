Divestment, also known as divestiture, refers to when a business sells off some assets (e.g. stocks, property, subsidiaries) to achieve some financial, ethical, or political goal. To divest from a business or class of businesses (e.g. energy companies that utilize fossil fuels) means to end financial and business relationships with them so neither party may continue to benefit financially from the other. 

A divestment campaign involves coordinated efforts by people who oppose an institution’s investments or business ties to particular types of companies, usually for political or ethical reasons. Divestment campaigns in higher education have typically....

Here are some materials that document the response of Barnard administration to divestment campaigns: 

## Divestment from South Africa

Campaigns to divest from businesses operating in South Africa in protest of the nation's system of apartheid had existed in the U.S and internationally since the 1960s. By taking a look at the archives of student publications the Barnard Bulletin and the Columbia Spectator, it is clear that divestment was an issue on Barnard and Columbia students' minds by the early 1970s.

In this issue of the Barnard Bulletin published on April 12, 1973, a Barnard student named Julie Simon stated that, as a candidate for the Barnard undergrad student seat on the Columbia Senate, she supported divestment campaigns in protest of the College's business ties to South Africa and Gulf Oil among other social issues.

The Board of Trustees Records (BC01.01) in the Barnard Archives includes many materials that shed light on the College administration's discussions of divestment. In the wake of intense student protests and the well-documented occupation of Hamilton Hall in April 1985, the Board of Trustees began taking concrete actions to enact an official divestment policy on South Africa business holdings in spring 1985. Here are a few excerpts of meeting minutes contained in the February 1984-December 1985 volume of meeting minutes, located in Series 1, Box 8 of the Board of Trustees Records.

This letter from Barnard President Ellen Futter, located in the Correspondence sub-series of the Board of Trustees Records, announced the Board's complete divestment from South Africa to the wider Barnard community:

From 1985 to 1993, the South Africa policy was frequently referenced by the Investment Committee, a standing Board committee that manages the “investment and reinvestment of the funds of the College” and establishes “investment guidelines in accordance with an investment policy approved by the Board.”[1.] Boxes 63 and 64 in Subseries 3.5 cover the 1980s and 1990s, at which time the College's policies on South African investments were often under discussion.

Following calls from Nelson Mandela for US institutions to reinvest in South Africa given the abolition of apartheid in 1994 and the improvement of social conditions, the Board quickly moved to reverse its 1985 divestment policy:

## Divestment from Israel
Adminsitrative materials related to campus debates about Israel-Palestine appear most prominently in [Series 6](https://collections.barnard.edu/public/repositories/2/archival_objects/24501) of the [President's Office Records](https://collections.barnard.edu/public/repositories/2/resources/332). Series 6  contains correspondence between Barnard College President Judith R. Shapiro (1994-2008) and academic departments, professors, administrators, administrative departments, students, and donors.

Shapiro penned this letter on November 7, 2002 in response to a petition signed by Barnard and Columbia community members calling on academic institutions to sanction Israel in response to increased violence in Israel-Palestine during a major uprising of Palestinians known as the Second Intifada.
